# Credit Default Prediction
## Problem Statement:
Financial threats are becoming a significant concern for commercial banks due to the ever-improving financial industry. One of the 
most prominent threats faced by commercial banks is predicting the credit risk of their clients. The objective of this project is to
develop a predictive model that can estimate the probability of credit default based on the characteristics of credit card owners and 
their payment history.

## Approach:
The project follows a classical machine learning pipeline consisting of the following steps:

#### Data Exploration: 
Understand and analyze the dataset to gain insights into its structure and content. Identify any patterns, 
anomalies, or missing data that may impact the model's performance.

#### Data Cleaning: 
Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies. This step ensures that the data
is in a suitable format for modeling.

#### Feature Engineering: 
Select, transform, or create relevant features that will aid in predicting credit default. This process may 
involve domain knowledge and data analysis to extract meaningful information.

#### Model Building: 
Experiment with various machine learning algorithms to find the best-fitted model for the credit default prediction
task. Common algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, ensemble techniques are used.

#### Model Testing:
Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics. This step helps identify the
model with the highest predictive accuracy.

#### Deployment:
Once a satisfactory model is achieved, deploy it to a production environment. You can use cloud platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or EC2 to host the model. Develop an API that allows users to input relevant data, such as credit card owner's characteristics and payment history. The API then uses the trained machine learning model to predict whether the client is likely to be a defaulter or not based on the provided information.

## Results:
The goal of this project is to develop a solution that accurately predicts the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's
characteristics and payment history. The success of the project will be determined by the model's performance on the test data, where it
should demonstrate a strong ability to classify instances as credit default or non-default with high precision and recall.

The final output of the project will be a trained machine learning model, along with the API, that can be used to predict credit default
probabilities for new credit card applications or existing credit card holders.
